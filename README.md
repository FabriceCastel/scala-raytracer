###The Essentials

Once you've installed sbt via ```brew install sbt```, use the ```sbt run``` command from the project root directory to compile & run and use the ```sbt test``` command to run unit tests.

This project has been put on hold in favour of WebGL sphere tracing shenanigans and was by and large a coding exercise to get familiar with Scala.
